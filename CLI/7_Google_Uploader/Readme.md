# 7. Google Uploader

App functionality: 

1. User is prompted to drag and drop an image to console
2. Prompted to rename it or decline
3. Prompted to shortify link 
4. The application should upload the image to a specified and pre-prepared folder in Google Drive.

⚠️ What to consider in the task:

- Use the official Google documentation and set up your application (obtain OAuth keys, etc.) in the Google Console.
- Keep in mind that the access token has an expiration period, and you should consider a scenario for its renewal, otherwise, the API won't work.
- To ensure that I can test the functionality of the API, please provide all the necessary credentials with the project.

⚠️ Use doc for inquirer, Google Drive, OAuth2 and [tinyurl](https://api.tinyurl.com/)
