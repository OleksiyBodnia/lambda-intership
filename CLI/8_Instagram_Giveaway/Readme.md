You have 20 files, each containing 100k phrases in each file. In total, there are 2M phrases. They were generated from two batches of 400 random words each, so they may be repeated across all or some of the files. You need to:

1.  To determine how many unique usernames exist in all the specified files (appearing at least once in any of the files).
2. To determine the number of usernames that simultaneously appear in all 20 files.
3. To find out how many usernames simultaneously appear in at least 10 files.
4. Output the results in the console by executing three separate functions.

⚠️ Measure the results of your program — how long it takes for the program to process. If your execution time exceeds a few seconds, it indicates a potential issue. Results with execution times of 5-12 seconds or more are not acceptable.
